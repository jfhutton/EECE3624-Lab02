# Lab02
In this lab you will analyze, modify and test an LED “blink” program on the ReadyAVR microcontroller board. The lab has three objectives: 1) become familiar with the AVR Studio development environment, including the debugger, 2) determine the ATmega128A’s clock speed by analyzing an assembly language program, and 3) modify the program to change the LED’s duty cycle and blink rate. You will also write a lab report describing the work you’ve done and answer questions posed in the lab.

Have fun!
